# üîê Online Security System

This project predicts whether a website is **safe** or **phishing/malicious**, using a set of well-known features commonly used in phishing detection systems. It is a **classification problem** built with a robust data pipeline, feature validation, and multiple machine learning models.

---

## üìä Problem Statement

Cybersecurity threats like phishing attacks are increasingly prevalent. This system leverages **categorical features** derived from URLs and website behavior to **classify websites as safe or unsafe**.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains a variety of features such as IP address usage, URL length, HTTPS presence, domain registration, traffic ranking, and more.

## üß± Project Architecture
MongoDB Atlas: Raw data is pushed to a NoSQL database hosted on the cloud.

Data Ingestion: Loads data from MongoDB and splits it into training and test sets.

Data Validation: Validates schema, checks for missing values, and generates data drift reports.

Data Transformation: Prepares the dataset for training by encoding features.

Model Training: Trains and evaluates models on the dataset.

Artifact Tracking: Each component generates and logs artifacts (train/test data, models, metrics).

---

## üß™ Models Used

The following models are trained and compared based on classification metrics:

'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(verbose = 1)  

'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier()  

'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier()  

'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(verbose = 1)  

'AdaBoost': AdaBoostClassifier()

## üì¶ Installation

 1. Clone the repository-
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-security-system.git
cd online-security-system  


2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)  


3. Install the required dependencies-
pip install -r requirements.txt  


4. Environment Setup-
MONGODB_URL="your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string"  


5. run in terminal- 
uvicorn app:app --reload    


This will open the interactive FastAPI Swagger UI, where you can test the API endpoints for training and prediction.
